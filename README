ohai .vim

Clone this bad boy into ~/.vim
Update those submodules with 'git submodule update --init'
Run 'ruby ~/.vim/install.rb' to install everything (assuming Vim is up and running), including Command-T (make sure to install using system Ruby -- 'rvm use system')

A big thanks to Zach Belzer, since I basically stole this from him. :)
